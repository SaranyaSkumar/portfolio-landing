                                Have you ever shared something on LinkedIn that you thought would get a lot of attention, only to see it didnâ€™t do as well as you hoped? Youâ€™re not the only one.
                            </p>

                            <p className="mb-4">
                                Hereâ€™s what happened to me recently:
                            </p>
                            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
                                <li>Post 1: 37 likes but got 62,088 impressions.</li>
                                <li>Post 2: 129 likes but only 24,674 impressions.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p className="mb-4">
                                It almost feels like LinkedIn has a mind of its own sometimes, doesnâ€™t it? ðŸ˜…
                            </p>

                            <p className="mb-6">
                                This made me think about how unpredictable video performance can be on platforms like LinkedIn. But you know what? Even with different results, Iâ€™ve made the choice to keep going.
                            </p>

                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Keep Going, Even When Itâ€™s Not Perfect</h2>
                            <p className="mb-4">
                                Some videos do really well, and others donâ€™t. And thatâ€™s okay. The biggest lesson Iâ€™ve learned is to stick with the process instead of worrying about perfect results.
                            </p>
                            <p className="mb-6">
                                Because hereâ€™s the truth: not every post will do great, but that doesnâ€™t mean you should stop trying.
                            </p>

                            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Hereâ€™s why I keep going:</h3>
                            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
                                <li>I believe in learning from every post. No matter if a post gets 37 likes or 129 likes, each one teaches me something about what works and what doesnâ€™t.</li>
                                <li>I believe in overcoming challenges. Low engagement? Thatâ€™s just a small hurdle. Iâ€™m in it for the long game.</li>
                                <li>I believe in sticking with it. The most successful people didnâ€™t stop after a few setbacks. They stayed with it, learned from it, and kept moving forward.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Enjoying the Journey</h2>
                            <p className="mb-4">
                                Today, Iâ€™m fine-tuning my approach and staying committed. Yes, some videos work great and others donâ€™t. But I genuinely enjoy the process of trying new things and growing through it all.
                            </p>
                            <p className="mb-6">
                                At the end of the day, social media is more than just likes and commentsâ€”itâ€™s about consistently showing up, sharing something meaningful, and staying true to yourself.
                            </p>

                            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">3 Lessons Iâ€™ve Learned From LinkedIn:</h3>
                            <ul className="list-decimal pl-5 mb-6">
                                <li><b>Stick to what you believe in.</b> Donâ€™t let the numbers distract you. Focus on sharing valuable content and being yourself.</li>
                                <li><b>Learn from everything.</b> Even when a post doesnâ€™t perform well, thereâ€™s always something to learn.</li>
                                <li><b>Be consistent.</b> The key to success is simply showing up regularly, no matter what.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                So, if youâ€™re reading this, remember to keep going, even when the results arenâ€™t what you expect. Every effort is part of building something bigger, even if itâ€™s not obvious right away.
